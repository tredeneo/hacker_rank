Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as: code, log files, spreadsheets, documents, etc.

We can match a specific string *X* in a test string *S* by making our regex pattern *X*. This is one of the simplest patterns. However, in the coming challenges, we'll see how well we can match more complex patterns and learn about their syntax.

# Task

You have a test string *S*. Your task is to match the string hackerrank. This is case sensitive.

# Code

```python
Regex_Pattern = r'hackerrank'
```
